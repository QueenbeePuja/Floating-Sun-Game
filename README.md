🌤️ Floating Sun – 2D Arcade Game (Unity)

    A simple 2D arcade-style game built using Unity and C#, where the player controls a floating sun that must navigate safely between clouds. 
    The game focuses on timing-based control, obstacle avoidance, scoring, and clean game-state management.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

              The player controls a sun character that levitates upward using the Spacebar

              Clouds act as obstacles — touching them results in game over

              Clearing a set of clouds increases the score

              Falling into the pit or hitting a cloud ends the game

              A Game Over screen appears with a Play Again button

              Restarting the game resets the score and starts from the beginning

              This project demonstrates a complete game loop: play → score → lose → restart.
